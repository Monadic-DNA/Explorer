# GWASifier

Match your DNA data against an open ended catalogue of DNA traits

## Development

### Preparing local data

Fetch the latest GWAS Catalog data from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/alternative into the `localdata` directory. This is "All associations v1.0.2 - with added ontology annotations, GWAS Catalog study accession numbers and genotyping technology" from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads. 

Create a new SQLite database at `localdata/gwas_catalog.sqlite`.

Load the contents of the TSV file into the SQLite database using your favorite method.
