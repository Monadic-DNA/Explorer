# Monadic DNA Explorer

Match your DNA data against an open ended catalogue of DNA traits with private AI-powered analysis

**ðŸ”— Repository:** [github.com/Monadic-DNA/Explorer](https://github.com/Monadic-DNA/Explorer)

## Features

- Interactive exploration of GWAS Catalog studies with quality-aware filtering
- Upload and analyze your personal genetic data (23andMe, AncestryDNA, etc.)
- Private AI analysis powered by Nillion's nilAI - your data is processed in a Trusted Execution Environment
- Save and export your results

## Development

### Preparing local data

Fetch the latest GWAS Catalog data from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/alternative into the `localdata` directory. This is "All associations v1.0.2 - with added ontology annotations, GWAS Catalog study accession numbers and genotyping technology" from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads.

Create a new SQLite database at `localdata/gwas_catalog.sqlite`.

Load the contents of the TSV file into the SQLite database using your favorite method.

### Running the Monadic DNA Explorer

The repository includes a Next.js single-page application for exploring studies stored in `localdata/gwas_catalog.sqlite`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server defaults to http://localhost:3000. You can override the database location by exporting `GWAS_DB_PATH` before starting the server.

## Production Deployment

### Using PostgreSQL in Production

For production deployments, you can use a remote PostgreSQL database instead of the local SQLite database:

1. **Set up your PostgreSQL database** with the GWAS catalog data
2. **Set the `POSTGRES_DB` environment variable** to your PostgreSQL connection string:

```bash
export POSTGRES_DB="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
# or for production with SSL:
export POSTGRES_DB="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"
```

3. **Build and start the application**:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

- `POSTGRES_DB`: PostgreSQL connection string (if set, takes precedence over SQLite)
- `GWAS_DB_PATH`: Path to SQLite database file (only used if `POSTGRES_DB` is not set)
- `NILLION_API_KEY`: (Optional) API key for Nillion's nilAI to enable private AI analysis of results

### Database Schema

The application expects a table named `gwas_catalog` with the standard GWAS Catalog schema. The PostgreSQL version should mirror the SQLite schema structure.

### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance with large GWAS datasets, apply the provided database indexes:

```bash
# For SQLite
sqlite3 /path/to/gwas_catalog.sqlite < sql/sqlite_indexes.sql

# For PostgreSQL
psql $POSTGRES_DB < sql/postgresql_indexes.sql
```

These indexes can improve query performance by 10-100x for search operations. See `sql/README.md` for detailed instructions.
