**Effective Date:** October 7, 2025 
**Version:** 1

## 1. Overview

Monadic DNA Explorer is operated by **Recherché Inc.** (“we,” “us,” or “our”).  
We are committed to protecting your privacy and limiting data collection to the minimum necessary to operate this research tool.

We do not:
- Store user-uploaded genetic data,
- Maintain user accounts or identifiers, or
- Contact users directly.

---

## 2. Data We Process

### 2.1 Genetic Data
- Processed **locally** in your browser or **temporarily in memory** for variant matching.
- Automatically deleted when the session ends.
- Never logged, stored, or backed up.

We do **not** retain, sell, or share genetic data with any party.

### 2.2 Analytics Data
We use **Google Analytics** to understand overall usage patterns and improve performance.  
Analytics data includes:
- Browser and OS type
- Device category
- Approximate location (city-level, anonymized)
- Session duration and page interactions

Google Analytics is configured with:
- **IP anonymization enabled**
- **No advertising or remarketing**
- **No cross-site tracking**
- **Short retention window** (as configured in GA4)

You can opt out anytime using browser settings or the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We do not combine analytics data with uploaded genetic data.

### 2.3 No Personal or Contact Information
We do not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or any persistent identifiers.  
We cannot send individualized messages or alerts.

---

## 3. Purpose of Data Processing

We use transient and anonymized data only to:
- Operate and improve the Service,
- Match variants with published research, and
- Measure performance in aggregate.

We do **not** use your data for:
- Marketing or profiling,
- External research, or
- Commercial resale.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

### 4.1 Nillion nilAI
When you use the optional “Private AI Analysis” feature:
- Your encrypted data is processed by Nillion’s infrastructure inside **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**.
- Recherché Inc. never accesses plaintext data and receives no retained output.

We are **not responsible** for data handling, breaches, or malfeasance within Nillion’s systems.

### 4.2 Google Analytics
Google Analytics operates under Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  
We configure it to minimize data collection and prevent identification.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- Genetic data is deleted at session end.
- Analytics data is retained only in aggregate form by Google Analytics under their standard data retention limits (typically 2–14 months).
- No backups or logs containing genetic data are maintained.

---

## 6. Cookies and Tracking

We use only:
- Essential session cookies for app functionality.
- Analytics cookies for aggregated usage statistics (anonymized).

You may disable cookies in your browser settings; core functionality will remain available.

---

## 7. Security

- All communications use **TLS (HTTPS)**.
- Computation is done **in-memory**, not in databases.
- Infrastructure is regularly audited for security.

However, no system is perfectly secure.  
We are **not liable** for third-party incidents (e.g., Nillion, Google Analytics, or hosting provider breaches).

---

## 8. No Contact or Notification Capability

Because we do not collect identifiers, we cannot:
- Send breach notices,
- Notify users of updates, or
- Verify user identities.

You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

---

## 9. Research Ethics

Monadic DNA Explorer does not perform independent research with user data.  
If future aggregated research use is proposed, we will implement **explicit opt-in consent** before participation.

---

## 10. International Processing

Temporary data processing occurs in the **United States**.  
By using the Service, you consent to such processing under U.S. law.

---

## 11. Children’s Privacy

This Service is intended for individuals **18 years or older**.  
We do not knowingly process data from minors.

---

## 12. Policy Updates

We may update this policy periodically.  
All changes will be posted publicly with a new **Effective Date**.  
Because we have no contact information, we cannot send direct notices.  
Continued use constitutes acceptance of updated terms.
