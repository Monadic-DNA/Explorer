## 1. Welcome to Monadic DNA Explorer

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the **Monadic DNA Explorer** web application (“Service,” “App,” or “Platform”), operated by **Recherché Inc.**, a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York City (“we,” “us,” or “our”).

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

---

## 2. Purpose and Scope

Monadic DNA Explorer is a **genetic research and educational platform** designed to let users explore genetic variants in the context of published Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).

Its **primary purpose** is to advance scientific understanding and research literacy — not to provide health or diagnostic advice.

---

## 3. Acceptance of Terms

By using the Service, you confirm that you:
- Have read, understood, and accepted these Terms and our Privacy Policy (incorporated by reference).
- Have the authority and legal capacity to enter into this agreement.

---

## 4. Description of Service

Through Monadic DNA Explorer, users can:
- Upload genotype data (e.g., from 23andMe or AncestryDNA).
- Explore published GWAS data curated by the **NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog**.
- Apply research filters and view quality scores for each study.
- Optionally use **private AI-based interpretation** via **Nillion’s nilAI**, which runs computations inside **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**.

The Service is designed for **temporary, in-session use** — uploaded data is processed **locally or transiently in memory**.  
We **do not permanently store or retain** user data on our servers.

---

## 5. Research and Educational Use Only

This Service is for **research and educational use only**. You must not use it to:
- Diagnose, treat, or prevent any medical condition.
- Make health, lifestyle, or genetic decisions.
- Replace professional healthcare or counseling advice.

Results represent **population-level associations** and should not be interpreted as medical or deterministic findings.

---

## 6. Eligibility

You must be **18 years or older** to use this Service.  
If you upload data belonging to someone else, you confirm that you have legal authorization to do so.

---

## 7. User Data and Ownership

### 7.1 Processing
Uploaded data is processed **locally** in your browser or **transiently in encrypted memory** during an active session.
We do **not** permanently store, back up, or retain user data after the session ends.

Analysis results (containing specific matched SNPs and calculated risk scores, not your full genetic file) are kept **in memory only** during your session and are automatically deleted when you close the browser or navigate away from the application. If you wish to preserve your results, you may manually export them as a JSON file to your local device using the export feature. We recommend that you:
- Store exported files securely on encrypted storage
- Delete exported files when no longer needed
- Never upload exported files to cloud services or unsecured locations

### 7.2 Ownership
You retain full ownership of your uploaded data.  
By using the Service, you grant Recherché Inc. a **temporary, limited license** to process that data solely for the purpose of providing the Service.

### 7.3 No Account System
We do not currently support or require user accounts or contact information.  
Because we do not collect user identifiers, we **cannot send notifications** (including policy updates or incident alerts).

Recherché Inc. is **not responsible** for any security breaches, malfeasance, or data incidents that occur within Nillion’s systems.
